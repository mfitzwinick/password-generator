# password-generator

The objective of this project was to create a password generator.  This can be used by an employee (or any other member of the user group). The user can select whether or not they would like to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters or numbers. They will also select how many characters should be included in the generated password. The length of the password will have to be at least 8 characters long, but cannot exceed 128 characters.

Once selections are made, they will be able to generate a random password based upon their choices.  In this particular case, I used alerts, confirms, and prompts to communicate with the user.  I don't think this is the most effective way to communicate with the user, but, for the purposes of this project, they are usable tools that seemed tp fulfill the parameters of the project.

# How to Access the Work

I will be supplying a url to the project along with a git hub url.  

# Things needed to view

All files are nested in the password-generator file.  The index.html is a file that is linked to both a style sheet (style.css) and to a javascript file (script.js).  Both the html and css files were provided by Bryan Swarthout at UCLA Extension.  The script file was created by me (A. Michele Fitzgerald-Winick).  For alternate viewports, a viewport meta tag was included on the html pages.

# Challenges and Observations

Given the relatively short amount of time we spent on javascript, I was not sure if I would be able to complete the project; however,  after drilling in, I felt an immense sense of accomplishment once I completed the task.  It took some time to think through the pseudo code, and I look forward to future exercises that will help me build those muscles. That may have been the most important lesson I gleaned from this project. Once I had the psuedo code in place, the execution began with some ease.   I was able to build out the variales and my "if" statements, and checked the logic in the console log.  Most of the "if" statements were straightforward, but I had to really think about the prompt input differently than the confirms.  

I enjoyed manipulating the arrays, and look forward to working with arrays now that I see the power of using them. I was pleased when the code worked that pushed the selected arrays into a new empty array.

The most challenging pieces were the functions.  Although I have a grasp of the for loop and Math.random piece, it took several tries to get it right.  For the final function, I was helped along with the provided content, but I need to re-review that to really get a solid grasp going forward.

Overall, this was a great starter-project for javascript.  I know that this is just a small piece of ice in the iceberg, but I found it enlightening in many ways.  I see this as a doorway into the language, and feel excited that there are so many amazing things yet to learn.
